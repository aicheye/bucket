only copy grades from courses that also exist in bucket,
also copy the "credits" column from the transcript into the "credits" property of the course
if a course has credits in the "attempted" column, but not any grade, it should be skipped
if a course has credits in the "earned" column, but not any grade, it should be skipped

list of non-numeric grade types (should be skipped, except for DNW, FTC, NMR, WF which should be converted to 32):

Grade 	Description
AEG 	Aegrotat: Credit granted under extraordinary circumstances in which course elements have been substantially completed, the completion of further assessments is not possible, and the student would otherwise receive a passing grade. An AEG is assigned by the associate dean, undergraduate of the student’s faculty and only in rare and persistent circumstances when assigning an INC grade is not appropriate.
AUD 	Audit: Student enrolled in the course but no credit granted. Note: An AUD grade will not be recognized or recorded for students enrolled in the following faculties:

    Engineering
    Mathematics (except post-degree students)
    Science

CR 	Credit: Credit granted for the course but not included in any average calculation.
DNW 	Did Not Write Examination: A course grade of INC or NMR not appropriate. No credit granted. The Average Calculation Value is 32.
FTC 	Failure to Complete: Course requirements not complete. No credit granted. The Average Calculation Value is 32.
INC 	

Incomplete Course: Course requirements not complete. INC should only be assigned when an instructor approves the completion of outstanding course element(s) after final grades have been submitted.

All assessment components for a course are to be completed during the term in which the course is taken. In exceptional circumstances, an instructor may grant a student an extension for specific outstanding course element(s), given credible documentation has been submitted by the student. (If the circumstance is related to a documented disability, students are encouraged to connect with AccessAbility Services should they wish to preserve the privacy of documentation.) The instructor will determine completion dates for outstanding course element(s) within a maximum lapse period of one year from when grades become official for the term in which the course was offered. The earned grade, the course element(s) to be completed, and the due date are documented on the INC grade form. A grade of INC will remain until the outstanding course element(s) have been graded or the lapse period has expired.

When the lapse period has expired, the INC reverts to the:

    earned grade, based on all completed course element(s), or
    if the course outline specified that the missing coursework was required to pass the course, the lesser of: the earned grade or 4% less than the passing grade.

Students intending to graduate must resolve any INC grades by completing the outstanding requirements or accepting the earned grade.
IP 	In Progress: Course requirements not complete. No grade has been assigned and no credit granted at this time. The course is in progress as a result of the course design or delivery rather than the student's performance. A final grade replaces the IP grade(s) when the coursework has been completed. Students intending to graduate must resolve any IP grades by completing the course or accepting an FTC grade.
MM 	Missing Mark: No credit granted and not included in any average calculation.
NCR 	No Credit: Treated as a failed course. Not included in any average calculation.
NG 	No Grade: Course in progress and cannot be dropped by the student.
NMR 	No Mark Reported: The student did not attend classes and no term work was submitted. No credit granted and the Average Calculation Value is 32.
UR 	Under Review: Grade under review or disciplinary proceedings underway, with a decision pending. No credit granted.

Normally, where disciplinary penalties are being considered or have been imposed for an academic offense committed in a course, a student may not drop that course. The UR grade will be replaced by the final course grade.
WD 	Withdrew: Course dropped after the third week of classes and before the WF period. No credit granted.
WF 	Withdrew/Failure: Course dropped after the tenth week of classes. No credit granted and Average Calculation Value is 32.
